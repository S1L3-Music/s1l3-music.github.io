						I have been making music for a while and decided that it would only be 
						decent of me to share some of the things I've used over the years as well as links to cool things and so on.<br>
							
							
						As someone who has basically no budget for any of this, cheap or free help is always appreciated and so it's only right to help and / or provide suggestions.
			
						Instrument packs, samples, links to VSTs or whatever else.<br>
						
						For example, for Reason users (<a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/welcome" target="_blank">Propellerheads Reason</a>) you can find a pack of instruments I've used for the past ... since 2012 at least. There are a significant number of them, I've picked out the best ones, but these were all used to make tracks that appear on releases. 
						<br>---<br>

						I have also provided links to the DAW and software that I use to make music. Where items are cross-platform I will provide links.
						<br>
						I hope some of this is helpful and useful to you.
						</P>

									PhasePlant Patches
									<br>-<br>
									PhasePlant is a modular synth used for Music and Sound Design (as in <a href="https://twitter.com/lydoel/status/1508101163345981445?s=20&t=LMBNzyuLztFF_z3fn9Ioew" target="_blank">this</a> case)
									made by KiloHearts - you could probably do just about anything in it. Comes with a ton of patches and is moderatley intuitive. You can also pay monthly, and while there is no "pay to own" like there is
									for Serum, every 12 months you get a $100 voucher which would contriubte nicely to the over cost of paying outright.

										Vital Patches
										<br>-<br>
										Vital is a FREE VST synth that supports Windows, Mac AND Linux. In terms of design its like if PhasePlant and Serum had a baby. There are three versions of it,
										free comes with the synth, a bunch of presets and some wavetables. The second version (Plus) is $25 and comes with slightly more presets and wavetables. The third and most expensive option (although still cheaper than either phaseplant OR serum)
										is $80. Free or paid, the VST operates the same - there are absolutely no limitations. Made by Matt Tytel, whom some of you may know as the maker of Helm.

									Genny VST
										<br>-<br>
									Genny is a VST that emulates the Sega Genesis'/Megadrive's YM2612 and SN76489 chips. It allows you to create Sega Genesis style FM music in your favorite DAW, and it will allow you to use almost the full capabilities of the two chips.<br>
									I have used this in two songs now, however for me it has a small quirk: it's out of tune. Sort of. If you're using Genny and only Genny, you'll be fine. If you're using it in conjunction with other VSTs and sounds, Genny will be out of tune. HOWEVER, when you render the song out, it will be in tune.

									Mixcraft 9 RS
										<br>-<br>
									I have used Mixcraft since forever. Originally it was something I had pirated just as a sort of better editor than Audacity. It is a fully featured DAW, the features of which have grown exponentially over time. Currently I use Mixcraft 9 RS (Recording Studio) which suits all of my needs but there is a Pro Studio version with a few more VSTs and autotune etc.

									GarageBand 
										<br>-<br>
									(and by extension, Phase84, Synthmaster One, Omega, Bassalicious, etc)<br>
									I have used GarageBand extensivley for a number of tracks since I've been on
									iOS/iPad OS and more recently I discovered that it has the ability, on iOS/iPad 
									OS to use AU plugins (which I think means Audio Unit).<br>
									Just as a sidenote: I own all of these on iOS. PC/Mac counterparts are considerably more
									expensive.
