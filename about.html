							About S1L3!

						My name ... is not S1L3, amazingly. S1L3 is a leet-speak version of my initials, SILE. S.I.L.E. 
						My initials, one of which is a cricketer my dad liked who I share ... nothing with. I know what he did, and why he's famous - I don't give a shit about sports or cricket and thus its just a name I don't like and wish I didn't have. The L is after one of my dads friends
and again, couldnt care less. Why its in my name is beyond me and I dislike it, but it is what it is. However, when naming me (so I'm told) my dad wanted for my initials to spell a word when put together, SILE = 
to his mind, "silly". It's not. Its the irish spelling of the name Sheila. Still, its the name I have and I'll be damned if I'm not going to exploit it for gain. 
						</P>

						I will tell you the S: Stevie. I grew up in a town called Abingdon, in Oxfordshire. Spending my life there until I was 31 I think. Abingdon is relativley small, and in 2022, relativley disapointing. Theres nothing there. Unless an abundance of turkish barbers, costa coffee shops and charity shops is your kind of thing.
						I currently live in Swindon, which has its own problems but is 100x better than Abingdon in terms of shops and variety. 
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						 I've always been musical as much as I remember, and my mum and dad have always listened to music. Mum was usually chart pop music and things like Celine Dion, M-People, George Michael, Madonna etc. Dad was more heavy metal, hard rock, although mostly growing up it was
						 Red Hot Chili Peppers, Talking Heads, The The. Later on we got a turntable and I was able to listen to AC/DC, Ted Nugent, Iron Maiden, The Cult, Big Audio Dynaminte, and so on. My mum had a Nolans record which I'm proud to say I never played.
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						As a young child I got Keyboard lessons, although this never amounted to anything significant, it was enough to give me the basics. I forget why I gave them up, and a small part of me regrets it but I've never really used the keyboard to "play" stuff. Although I can, I can do a mean Lady Madonna rendition, for me its more of an interface. An input device. Or a tool for ideas.
						Learning the guitar was something I did off of my own back. I used to spend most of my lunch breaks in the schools music block. I picked up a bass first because Chili Peppers > Flea > bass. Not a difficult leap to make. I learned a few things starting with thier tune "Don't Forget Me". I then wanted to move onto guitar. Because Iron Maiden > Dave Murray > Electric Guitar.

						My first experience of using a computer to do music was at an art project a jobless me had been placed on by either the Job Center or Connexions (which no longer exists) called Multiple Arts Project, or MAP. Which
essentially was a doss about, but you could do several creative projects rainging from film making, painting/drawing, to music. Which they had set up on a laptop with Reason 3. The songs from that you can hear on this site - if you can find the link ;)
There also was an exhibition in a town called Banbury where basically all of the creative stuff was forgotten about because I met a girl there (which ended badly and to this day I'm not actually sure what she did at her one).

								Over the years its gone from about as basic as it can get to the "standard" producers computer minus studio monitors and a room full of equipment. But all the while with basically no budget. I used to pirate things at first but these days its a fully paid for DAW (Mixcraft 9) and I own Serum, Phase Plant and a smattering of others.

								There you have it. You've learned about me. Well done :)
