							About S1L3!

						My name ... is not S1L3, amazingly. S1L3 is a leet-speak version of my initials, SILE. S.I.L.E. 
						My initials, one of which is a cricketer my dad liked who I share ... nothing with. I know what he did, and why he's famous - I don't give a shit about sports or cricket and thus its just a name I don't like and wish I didn't have. The L is after one of my dads friends
and again, couldnt care less. Why its in my name is beyond me and I dislike it, but it is what it is. However, when naming me (so I'm told) my dad wanted for my initials to spell a word when put together, SILE = 
to his mind, "silly". It's not. Its the irish spelling of the name Sheila. Still, its the name I have and I'll be damned if I'm not going to exploit it for gain. 
						</P>

						I will tell you the S: Stevie. I grew up in a town called Abingdon, in Oxfordshire. Spending my life there until I was 31 I think. Abingdon is relativley small, and in 2022, relativley disapointing. Theres nothing there. Unless an abundance of turkish barbers, costa coffee shops and charity shops is your kind of thing.
						I currently live in Swindon, which has its own problems but is 100x better than Abingdon in terms of shops and variety. 
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						 I've always been musical as much as I remember, and my mum and dad have always listened to music. Mum was usually chart pop music and things like Celine Dion, M-People, George Michael, Madonna etc. Dad was more heavy metal, hard rock, although mostly growing up it was
						 Red Hot Chili Peppers, Talking Heads, The The. Later on we got a turntable and I was able to listen to AC/DC, Ted Nugent, Iron Maiden, The Cult, Big Audio Dynaminte, and so on. My mum had a Nolans record which I'm proud to say I never played.
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						As a young child I got Keyboard lessons, although this never amounted to anything significant, it was enough to give me the basics. I forget why I gave them up, and a small part of me regrets it but I've never really used the keyboard to "play" stuff. Although I can, I can do a mean Lady Madonna rendition, for me its more of an interface. An input device. Or a tool for ideas.
						Learning the guitar was something I did off of my own back. I used to spend most of my lunch breaks in the schools music block. I picked up a bass first because Chili Peppers > Flea > bass. Not a difficult leap to make. I learned a few things starting with thier tune "Don't Forget Me". I then wanted to move onto guitar. Because Iron Maiden > Dave Murray > Electric Guitar. 
						
						</P>

						My first experience of using a computer to do music was at an art project a jobless me had been placed on by either the Job Center or Connexions (which no longer exists) called Multiple Arts Project, or MAP. Which
essentially was a doss about, but you could do several creative projects rainging from film making, painting/drawing, to music. Which they had set up on a laptop with Reason 3. The songs from that you can hear on this site - if you can find the link ;)
There also was an exhibition in a town called Banbury where basically all of the creative stuff was forgotten about because I met a girl there (which ended badly and to this day I'm not actually sure what she did at her one).				
						</P>
						
						<P class="pbackground">
								Over the years its gone from about as basic as it can get to the "standard" producers computer minus proper studio monitors (I have pretty good reference media monitors) and a room full of equipment. But all of this basically done with no budget. I used to pirate things at first (didn't everybody?) but these days its a fully paid for DAW (Mixcraft 9) and I own Serum, Phase Plant and a smattering of others.
								</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
								There you have it. You've learned about me. Well done :)
