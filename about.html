				Both my mother and father are keen listeners of music, and so for my whole life it has been a presence. Mother is mainly pop/chart music and my dad is more rock/metal.

 

When I was younger I had Keyboard lessons which lasted a little while until I decided (for reason I can't remember) that I just didn't want to anymore. However it was enough to give me the basics, and a solid grasp on tune "chopsticks", so off I went with that. I've always had this ability to hear something and then figure out the notes and play them. This is more true for guitar playing than it is for the Keyboard because I never really learned how to play anything on the Keyboard and/or Piano. Yes, Chopsticks. And I know chords and scales and things. But I use them more as writing tools. It is easier to play the notes into the software rather than draw each one manually with a mouse/finger.

 

I don't read music, although I do understand music written on a staff and where all the notes are - it's just not something I can read fluently or quickly. I need to take my time and work out what the notes on it are.

 

Guitar tabs are much easier to read, but in most cases usually inaccurate. Although so is learning it by ear. For example, did you know that Green Day's "Basket Case" is played on a guitar tuned to E flat. So you would play it starting on the 7th fret. I didn't know that at the time, so I just found the right chord (which was on the 6th fret of my standard tuned guitar) and played it that way - you don't need to be tuned down at all.

 

I also never had guitar lessons. I picked up a bass at first and tried to play Red Hot Chili Peppers bass lines - Don't Forget Me was my main starting point I believe, but eventually I got bored and wanted to play the guitar instead. The computers in the school library was enough to tell me what tuning it should be, I sat with a guitar next to the piano and tuned it - that was it really.
