						<P>
						What is contained here are the very first ever computer / MIDI recordings I ever did. 
						I don't know how I have them (although thinking about it, I think I burnt them to a CD to take home). 
						They were created at something I attended called MAP (multi-arts project) and they had a set up a that used a laptop with Reason 3 (I think?). 
						And once I was shown the basics, I started to make stuff. None of it good, however.
						Although at the time I was probably proud of it. One of them (Harmonix) was used as part of a film we made 
						(Saturday the 14th - original name I know). The other potentially was made WITH someone who just pressed random keys and I worked around it.
						</P>
						<P>
						These tracks have never been released, they have never been edited, and for many years not even played. They could be called <i>at best</i> experimental.
						</P>
						<P>
						They have been run through an EQ and things just to clean them up, improve volume and things.  
						</P>
						<P>
						What is continued with the PSS-270 started here I guess. Enjoy?
						</P>
