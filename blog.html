						<h4>Releases</h4><br>
						<i>09/05/2022</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
						
						<P>
						I have just finished up a second EP. In 2022? What? After an album as well?
							</P>
							<P>
							All I can say is the ideas are tumbling out. And a more ... consistent-ish direction is being found. Albums are hard. How many tracks? 
								What kind of songs? Any kind of theme? Can I even come up with anything good? 
								And while I THINK I accomplished that with Black Light - it kind of left me feeling a bit like I put too much pressure on myself 
								to come up with something instead of how I normally work which is "when the ideas come" essentially.
							</P>
							<P>
Every album up until maybe Lost Planet was made by simply collecting everything I had worked on up until then, 
								and it felt like a reasonable number of tracks, although strangely - and coincidentally - somehow I always
								manage to average around 40 minutes. Anyway, EP 2022, Black Light and this EP mark an extremely 
								creative period and I hope it continues, but I will not be putting pressure on myself to create 
								releases and throw them out as soon as possible after this one.
							</P>
							<P>
								The thinking behind it usually is "this is so cool I need to get it out there right now" and while that may feel like
								the right thing to do at the time, sometimes you leave it, go back a bit later and see how you feel. Each of the 5 songs on the newest EP (called "The Other Direction")
								was something where I went "this is so cool I should release it" and instead ended up sitting on them while other ideas came out - those other ideas will make up whatever the next album ends up being, 
								but for now you get an album of 14 tracks followed by an EP of 5 and then hopefully the 6 or so tracks I'm still sitting on will make a future album. When the ideas come.

						<h4>Annoying Reason</h4><br>
						<i>25/04/2022</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
						
						<P>
						You may have read previously around the site that I historically 
lost project files for music and generally wasn’t all that careful
with keeping them and so on. Minus loosing a bunch when a hard drive died.
The main reason though was laziness.
You see, the first DAW I used, Reason 5, was unable to export stems. 
</P>
<P>
What is a stem? A stem is one of the individual isolated tracks of a song,
for example the drums. Or the vocals. Songs are made of many many layers
and the stems are all of these individual layers. Reason 5 could only 
export the final result. In order to get the stems you would need to select
one track, export it, select the next track, export it - it was tedious, 
essentially. Doing it one by one rather than pushing a button and pressing “go”. 
</P>
<P>
However I still kept most of the Reason Project files - so if I need to get anything I could. 
</P>
<P>
Fast forward to 2022 and I decide I should probably export all of the stems for 
the Reason tracks - just in case. If the original project file corrupts or gets
lost at the very least the audio waveforms exist. It was at this point that I started to hate Reason. 
</P>
<P>
Reason 12, which is what the current version is, has taken a fairly asinine turn 
from what it used to be - for example I used to always, by default 
“detach sequencer window” - the sequencer is the part that has all of the midi tracks, 
note lanes and stuff. Can’t do that now, for reasons I cannot work out. You can detach
the “rack” which contains all of the instruments and you can detach the “mixer” which 
frees up the sequencer window a little bit, but now you’ve got several windows open - 
it’s cluttered and pointlessly convoluted.
</P>
<P>
Then there is exporting stems. Which it does! Hooray. Except if your project
files are older or what it calls “legacy” files, which all of mine are. 
Then it won’t export stems.  The way Reason used to work was that it had a 14 
channel mixer which all of your instruments were linked to. If you needed more 
you could add another 14 channel mixer, etc. looked like this:<br>
<img src="blog/1.png" width="70%">
</P>
<P>
Reason 12 registers that 14 channel mixer as 1 device. And so when you export stems, 
it exports 1 single file. To fix that issue, you need to create several separate 
individual mixers in Reason 12:<br>
<img src="blog/2.png" width="70%">
</P>
<P>

And manually re-route every single element of your project file to them (I have not found any automatic way of doing this):<br>
<img src="blog/3.png" width="70%">
</P>
<P>
And THEN you need to re-adjust all of your levels and re-mix it all so it sounded how it did previously, fix any automation. 
Which is made trickier by the fact that on the mixer window, there are no transport controls (play, pause, etc). 
So you have to flick backwards and forwards between windows to do that (usually space bar works as start and 
stop but for me, on the mixer window, did nothing). But once you’ve done all of that, then you can export all of the stems:<br>
<img src="blog/4.png" width="70%">
</P>
<P> 
I’ll be honest after about doing 3 songs I gave up again. It wanted me to locate a bunch of ReFills 
(extra sounds and such) and I don’t know where I stored them and I lost patience. 
</P>
<P>
Reason 5 had its limitations. You couldn’t record audio into it, so no importing of audio tracks, 
recording of vocals or instruments etc. A workaround I used was to chop audio files up and trigger 
them with midi on something like Kong. I believe there was some separate program that integrated 
with Reason and filled that gap, but I never used it. It also didn’t support VSTs until version 9 or so? 
Reason 5 couldn’t bounce mixer tracks. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the features they’ve added and things it can do … about the best thing they’ve done is make 
Reason a VST. At this point I would rather use just the instruments in a different sequencer that 
visually makes more sense, has a better, less cluttered work flow etc. The downside is you can’t 
just get the VST on its own. The Rack it’s called. It’s part of the full Reason program. Which is a shame, 
in my opinion. I know I would almost certainly prefer a VST of Reason instruments over the full sequencer 
program, especially in its current state.
