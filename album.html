						<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1238222580_16.jpg" style="float:left" width="250" height="250">
						The First Collection follows a period from about 2012 to 2016 which originally were on albums of thier own but ... 
						stupid names, stupid track layouts, songs that shouldn't have been there, really. So rather than have separate
						albums cluttering up the place (also with stupid album art) I decided to just select those I'm most fond of, 
						and have them as part of two collections (The Second Collection being the other).<br>&nbsp;<br>
						While you could call this a compilation - and it kind of is a collection of material from 2010 to 2016-ish, 
						to me its just an album of material that was written during that period of time.<br>&nbsp;<br> 
						All of these songs, without exception, were done in a program called Reason. It was the first program I ever had any experience using 
						(albeit it a much earlier version) and so when I was looking for software, I got this one. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						It's hard for me to recommend it today as I have not really used any kind of up to date version beyond Reason 10 - 
						I have no idea what current state it's in.<br>&nbsp;<br>
						Unfortunately, almost none of the source files for this album can be found. I used to have a stupid mindset where (on older computers) space was at a premium, and keeping things I didn't need was just taking up space that I needed - although to be fair to myself, I did also loose a bunch of files when a 250GB drive crashed on me. But I was (at the time) like "well I've finished it, why would I ever need to go back into it?" -_- Dear oh dear.<br>

						Much like the first Collection this is a collection of material from around 2016 to 2019-ish. The large majority 
						of it was written using Reason but this time I started to use a few other things.<br>&nbsp;<br>
						Having a child and not always having access to a PC I went looking for apps that might allow me to accomplish the same thing. 
						I found two on Android: Caustic3 (which I'm pretty sure the developer has abandoned) and FL Studio. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						Caustic3 is/was rack based very much like Reason was and so it very quickly made sense and I started working on things. 
						Sound quality isn't quite up to par of other apps or programs, although you can use samples - still, I made a few 
						tracks using it one of which (Vendetta) appears on this album.<br>&nbsp;<br>
						Music making on Android (which is what I had at the time) while possible, often just flat out isn't supported 
						because of the sheer number of potential Android devices and different sound hardware - you can't account for 
						all of them and you can't make it consistent across all of them. What might work well on one, won't work well on another, etc.<br>

						Written from the end of 2020 to 2021 , this marked a change in sound for me. 
						Where traditionally I'd used a desktop computer and software on that, I switched to using an iPad and iPhone and 
						two pieces of software - GarageBand and FL Studio. All of this album was written in GarageBand. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						It was named 33 because that year I turned 33 and because it happens to be one of the speeds
						(well, 33 1/3) of a vinyl record. Hence the album cover, which is actually me holding up Eminem's 
						"Music To Be Murdered By" lovely transparent "Black Ice" record - although none of that is visible, 
						so you'd never have known if I didn't tell you ;)<br>

						Almost everything on this album is from FL Studio and was written at the end of 2021 and into 2022. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						Continuing the sound that emerged during the album "33" and "EP 2021" it is much more energetic, frenetic, and somewhat dark.<br>&nbsp;<br>
						It isn't strictly all new material - three songs containing vocals have found a place here, 
						after being sat in the void for a very very long time. They seemed to fit the mood of the album, and so I included them. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						I wish more often that my work could have a voice, but I'm not a singer and finding one to work on material basically 
						only me would listen to is probably not that easy. Having said that, a song from Luna (or if you're on Bandcamp EP 2021) 
						called "Belong" has my voice on it. Its just heavily processed and roboticized (if thats even a word).
						In fact I think each verse is tuned specifically to the notes it (me) "sings". You can't tell its me.
						But its me. Well, like 20% me, 80% robot effect from GarageBand.<br>

						This album was written during 2022 and uses a combination of PC work as well as iPhone/iPad work (GarageBand with a host of AU plugins).

As far as the PC goes, I ditched Reason - I've been using since I first started writing music on a computer and it just ... I wanted a change. So I switched to another program I've always used for mixing and editing and completely ignored as far as midi recording and such: MixCraft.

A wonderfully capable and compatible DAW with a great work flow ... its just easy to use. Also cheap. if anyone was looking for one :)<br>
