							Welcome!
							<br>
							To the mobile version of my website.
						</P>
						
						<P class="pbackground">
							I have never known how to classify or catagorize what I do other than: 
							I make instrumentals for a non-existant singer. I'm certainly not a vocalist 
							(although a couple of tracks do have my voice on). Around this website is
							information, history, resources and links to things that might help you. 
							I am in no way a good source if information or help - most of what I do and 
							how I do it, I've learnt to do myself.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
							I've made music for most of my life in one form or another. I wouldn't say it was all good.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
							For the most part (like ... 95%), my output is original material. 
							Of note, going forward, there are two main ways to listen to my music: 
							Bandcamp and then everything else. BandCamp has always been my go-to and 
							contains everything I've done to date. Well not everything - very early 
							songs and various other tracks aren't there (although if you're curious enough, 
							they might be around the site somewhere). For distributed releases 
							(Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music) some of the tracks had to be edited to 
							remove tracks that contained samples and things of that nature. 
							There is one slight negative of this sample/copyright thing however 
							is that one EP flat out cannot be released as it contains 3/5 that are sampled and ... 
							basically re-worked versions of the songs they were sampled from. I did re-create 
							elements of them manually, but still. Best not try and push my luck 
							(still on Bandcamp for free though).
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
						Here is what I use:<br>&nbsp;<br>
						
						Mixcraft 9 RS (Windows 11)<br>
FL Studio (iOS/iPadOS)<br>
GarageBand (iOS/iPadOS)<br>
Caustic 3 (I wish the developer would update this)<br>
Reason (Windows)<br>
and to mix all of my tracks, I use Mixcraft.<br>&nbsp;<br>
 
Hardware wise it is the following:<br>
 
Donner DMK25 Midi Keyboard<br>
M-Audio Keyrig49 Midi Keyboard<br>
Ibanez Electric Guitar<br>
Zoom G1XNext Guitar Pedal<br>
Computer specs are: Ryzen 3200G, 16GB Ram, GTX1050<br>
Also use an Asus X550C laptop here and there
(It's old but an SSD breathed new life into it.)
