						ABOUT ME<br>
						<img src="images/me.webp" width="60%"><br>
							My name ... is not S1L3, amazingly. S1L3 is a leet-speak version of my initials, SILE. S.I.L.E.
							My initials, one of which is a cricketer my dad liked who I share ... nothing with. I know what he did, 
							and why he's famous - I don't give a shit about sports or cricket and thus its just a name I don't like 
							and wish I didn't have. The L is after one of my dads friends and again, couldnt care less.
							Why its in my name is beyond me and I dislike it, but it is what it is. However, when naming me 
							(so I'm told) my dad wanted for my initials to spell a word when put together, SILE = to his mind, 
							"silly". It's not. Its the irish spelling of the name Sheila. Still, its the name I have and I'll be 
							damned if I'm not going to exploit it for gain.

						I will tell you the S: Stevie. I grew up in a town called Abingdon, in Oxfordshire. 
						Spending my life there until I was 31 I think. Abingdon is relativley small, and in 2022, 
						relativley disapointing. Theres nothing there. Unless an abundance of turkish barbers, 
						costa coffee shops and charity shops is your kind of thing. I currently live in Swindon, 
						which has its own problems but is 100x better than Abingdon in terms of shops and variety.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
						I've always been musical as much as I remember, and my mum and dad have always listened 
						to music. Mum was usually chart pop music and things like Celine Dion, M-People, 
						George Michael, Madonna etc. Dad was more heavy metal, hard rock, although mostly 
						growing up it was Red Hot Chili Peppers, Talking Heads, The The. Later on we got a 
						turntable and I was able to listen to AC/DC, Ted Nugent, Iron Maiden, The Cult, 
						Big Audio Dynaminte, and so on. My mum had a Nolans record which I'm proud to say I never played.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
						As a young child I got Keyboard lessons, although this never amounted to anything significant, 
						it was enough to give me the basics. I forget why I gave them up, and a small part of me regrets 
						it but I've never really used the keyboard to "play" stuff. Although I can, I can do a mean 
						Lady Madonna rendition, for me its more of an interface. An input device. Or a tool for ideas. 
						Learning the guitar was something I did off of my own back. I used to spend most of my lunch 
						breaks in the schools music block. I picked up a bass first because Chili Peppers > Flea > bass. 
						Not a difficult leap to make. I learned a few things starting with thier tune "Don't Forget Me". 
						I then wanted to move onto guitar. Because Iron Maiden > Dave Murray > Electric Guitar.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
							Over the years its gone from about as basic as it can get to the "standard" 
							producers computer minus studio monitors and a room full of equipment. 
							But all the while with basically no budget. I used to pirate things at first but these days 
							its a fully paid for DAW (Mixcraft 9) and I own Serum, Phase Plant and a smattering of others.
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
							My first experience of using a computer to do music was at an art project a jobless me had 
							been placed on by either the Job Center or Connexions (which no longer exists) called Multiple Arts Project, 
							or MAP. Which essentially was a doss about, but you could do several creative projects rainging from film making, 
							painting/drawing, to music. Which they had set up on a laptop with Reason 3. The songs from that you can hear 
							on this site - if you can find the link ;) There also was an exhibition in a town called Banbury where 
							basically all of the creative stuff was forgotten about because I met a girl there (which ended badly 
							and to this day I'm not actually sure what she did at her one).
