						I have never known how to classify or catagorize what I do other than: I make instrumentals for a non-existant singer. I'm certainly not a vocalist (although a couple of tracks do have my voice on).
						Around this website is information, history, resources and links to things that might help you. I am in no way a good source if information or help - most of what I do and how I do it, I've learnt to do myself.
						
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
						I've made music for most of my life in one form or another. I wouldn't say it was all good. 
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						For the most part (like ... 95%), my output is original material. Of note, going forward, there are two main ways to listen to my music: Bandcamp and then everything else. 
						BandCamp has always been my go-to and contains everything I've done to date. Well not everything - very early songs and various other tracks aren't there (although if you're curious enough, they might be around the site somewhere). 
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						For distributed releases (Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music) some of the tracks had to be edited to remove tracks that contained 
						samples and things of that nature. There is one slight negative of this sample/copyright thing however is that one EP flat out 
						cannot be released as it contains 3/5 that are sampled and ... basically re-worked versions of the songs they were sampled from.
						I did re-create elements of them manually, but still. Best not try and push my luck (still on Bandcamp for free though).
						</P>
						<P class="pbackground">
						Bandcamp is the original unedited pieces as they were meant to be. And also, completely free. 
						Not because I'd get into trouble if I charged for copyrighted material although ... obviously thats a big factor, 
						but because I never made them to make money. So while you CAN get them on other platforms (I just wanted them on there to be honest, there is no real goal to sell anything) Bandcamp is your best bet.
						</P>
						<P  class="pbackground">
						Also SoundCloud, sometimes I post works in progress and remixes there.

								<P class="pbackground">
								It's changed over time based on the equipment available.<br>
								Initially it started out as an extremely basic computer and a Yamaha PSS-270 keyboard plugged into the Line-In jack. 
								None of these tracks are great quality but can be found on the site for those curious.
								</P>
								<P class="pbackground">
								Over the years it became DAW software (primarily Reason but these days iOS and Mixcraft on PC) and a MIDI Keyboard - 
								currently it is the following:<br>&nbsp;<br>
								
								Mixcraft 9 Pro Studio <i>(Windows 11)</i><br>
								FL Studio <i>(iOS/iPadOS)</i><br>
								GarageBand <i>(iOS/iPadOS)</i><br>
								Caustic 3 (I wish the developer would update this)<br>
								Reason <i>(Windows)</i>
								and to mix all of my tracks, I use Mixcraft.<br>&nbsp;<br>
								VST's I use are:<br>
								Phase Plant, Massive, Serum<br>
								Vital, Kairatune and a bunch more.<br>&nbsp;<br>								
								Hardware wise it is the following:<br>&nbsp;<br>
								Korg NanoStudio<br>
								Donner DMK25 Midi Keyboard<br>
								M-Audio Keyrig49 Midi Keyboard<br>
								Ibanez Electric Guitar<br>
								Zoom G1XNext Guitar Pedal<br>
								Computer specs are: Ryzen 5 2600, 16GB Ram, GTX1050<br>
								Also use an HP Envy i7 laptop here and there<br>
