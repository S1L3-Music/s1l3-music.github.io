						<P>
						For most of my life (or at least that of it which I can remember) I have both been interested in music, and created music. 
						</P>
						<P>
						For the most part (like ... 95%), my output is all original material. There are two main ways to listen to my music. The main one is Bandcamp. This has always been my go-to and contains everything I've done to date (well not everything - very early songs and various other tracks aren't there). These are collections as they were created and intended.
						</P>
						<P>
						For distributed releases (Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music) these had to be shaken up a little bit to remove tracks that contained samples and things of that nature. There is one slight negative of this sample/copyright thing however is that one EP flat out cannot be released as it contains 3/5 that are sampled and ... basically re-worked versions of the songs they were sampled from. I did re-create elements of them manually, but still. Best not try and push my luck (still on Bandcamp for free though).
						</P>
						<P>
						Bandcamp is the original unedited pieces as they were meant to be. And also, completely free. Not because I'd get into trouble if I charged for copyrighted material although ... obviously thats a big factor, but because I never made them to make money. So while you CAN get them on other platforms (I just wanted them on there to be honest, there is no real goal to sell anything) Bandcamp is your best bet.
						</P>
						<P>
						Also SoundCloud, sometimes I post works in progress and remixes there.

								How Do I Make Music?

								<P>
								It's changed over time based on the equipment available.<br>
								Initially it started out as an extremely basic computer and a Yamaha PSS-270 keyboard plugged into the Line-In. None of these tracks are great quality but can be found on the site for those curious.
								</P>
								<P>
								Over the years it became DAW software (primarily Reason but these days iOS and Mixcraft on PC) and a MIDI Keyboard - currently it is the following:
								</P>
								<P>
								Mixcraft<br>
								FL Studio<br>
								GarageBand<br>
								Caustic 3 (I wish the developer would update this)<br>
								Reason<br>
								and to mix all of my tracks, I use Mixcraft.
